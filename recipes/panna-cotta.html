        <h2>How to make panna cotta !</h2>
        Panna cotta is a traditional, easy, and delicious Italian custard. I had a difficult time finding a good, simple recipe on the Internet, so I made up my own recipe. It tastes just like the panna cotta served at Italian restaurants. Serve with warm hot fudge sauce and fresh raspberries on top. This keeps well for several days in the refrigerator.
